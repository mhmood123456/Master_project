This repository contains three key files for my master thesis focused on classification and segmentation tasks. The code is executed in Google Colab for easy execution and testing. Here's a brief overview of the files:
<br><br>
Dataset Download: Download the required dataset from Kaggle. Ensure you have your Kaggle API credentials set up to fetch the dataset directly.<br>
Classification Code: This script focuses on performing classification tasks on the dataset. <br>
Segmentation Code: This script implements segmentation tasks based on the provided dataset. <br><br>
Setup Instructions <br>
Download Dataset: First, download the dataset from Kaggle by following the instructions in the dataset download script. <br>
Set Dataset Path: Modify the dataset file path in the classification and segmentation scripts based on where the dataset is stored on your system or Colab environment. Update the path in the code accordingly
